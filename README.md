# Tiger-Express

This repo contains my TigerExpress project. TigerExpress was a project I came up with after experiencing my university's mailing system. The mailing system was entirely pen and paper. You could have a package delivered to the school, however it would take a day or more for it to be processed by the mailroom staff. You did not receive any notification when it was ready unless you manually walked into the mailroom. The lines to pick up a package were often very long and slow. This inspired me to develop a solution to better streamline the processing of packages. Using a Raspberry Pi and a barcode scanner, I implemented a program that read barcodes from a package and would map this package to a student and notify them via email that it was ready for pickup. This program was written in Python with the use of MySQL to store package and mailroom employee information. This wasn't adopted by the school but I found it to be a great way to provide a solution to a common issue a community was facing.
