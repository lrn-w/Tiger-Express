# Tiger-Express

This repo contains my TigerExpress project, which involved the use of a barcode scanner and a Rasperry Pi to read in barcodes from a parcel to simulate processing and notifying the recipient of delivery. The goal of this project was to digitize the mailing system at my unversity as its process was done by pen and paper. You would have to physically walk in and check daily if your package was ready for pickup and with this project the mailroom could minimize wait time and streamline the process by sending out notifications when parcels were ready.
